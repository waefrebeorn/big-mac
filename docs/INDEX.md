# Big Mac DAW — Wired/Open Ledger

## Cloned vendored dependency
- `third_party/SDL2-2.32.10/` — SDL2 2.32.10 built from source as a static
  library. **The only third-party; everything else is ours.** Chosen for
  portable windowing + portable audio across macOS/Linux/Windows.

## Reference sources studied (R002)
- `~/ref/ardour/` — Ardour (`libs/ardour/audioengine.cc`, `graph.cc`)
- `~/ref/lmms/` — LMMS (`src/core/AudioEngine.cpp`, `midi/MidiApple.cpp`)
Lessons applied: staged render (schedule→instruments→effects), Xrun
try-lock, DAG worker model.

## Wired (verified by `make test`)
| Capability | Verify |
|---|---|
| Engine boot + transport (sample-accurate) | `make test` |
| Lock-free SPSC command queue (UI→engine) | `make test` |
| Session model (2-track, clips, notes, save/load) | `make test` |
| DSP graph + mixer (pan, gain, mute/solo) | `make test` |
| Subtractive synth (osc/env/filter, 16 voices) | `make test` |
| Compressor, delay, reverb, sampler | `make test` |
| WAV write (16-bit PCM + 32-bit float) | `make test` |
| Offline render (oracle parity with live) | `make test` |
| Recursive learn/fix feedback loop | `make test` (tuner converges) |
| Staged render pipeline (schedule→instr→fx) | `make test` |
| Xrun detection + counter (try-lock, never blocks) | `make test` |
| Insert FX chain (comp/reverb/delay per track) | `make test` |
| CoreMIDI input (enumerate + open by name) | launched, opened "Launchpad MK2" |
| Text UI (5×7 bitmap font: labels/numbers) | `build/wb_daw` shows time/BPM/dB |

## Open (next)
| Capability |
|---|
| Plugin scan + third-party plugin hosting (.clap) |
| Project save/load (.wbus file format) |
| Automation envelopes (per-parameter curves) |
| Waveform display (audio clips on arrangement) |
| Recording (audio/MIDI capture) |
| Additional synth/FX units |
| Undo/redo |
| Launchpad LED feedback |
